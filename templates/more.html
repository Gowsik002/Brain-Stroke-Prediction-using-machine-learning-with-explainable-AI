        <div class="info-box">
            <p>A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of your brain is interrupted or reduced, depriving brain tissue of oxygen and nutrients. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die. There are two main types of stroke: ischemic, caused by a blockage in an artery, and hemorrhagic, caused by a rupture in a blood vessel.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="info-box">
            <p>Common symptoms of a stroke include sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or difficulty understanding speech; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance, or lack of coordination; and sudden severe headache with no known cause.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p>After a stroke, it's important to make lifestyle changes to reduce the risk of another stroke. This may include quitting smoking, managing high blood pressure, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and eating a balanced diet.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p>Family support and education are also vital for stroke recovery and prevention. Caregivers and family members should understand the signs of stroke, how to provide support during recovery, and how to help prevent future strokes through lifestyle changes and medication adherence.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p>If you or someone you know is experiencing symptoms of a stroke, it's essential to seek medical attention immediately. Every minute counts, as early treatment can significantly improve outcomes and reduce the risk of long-term disability.</p>
